 # UnityTetrisProject
Made it for a hackathon but unity didnt build it in time to submit it lol.

Features:

 Basic tetris game (classic rules) 

 Selectable grids for specific practice

 Randomize/Unrandomize dropping pieces

 Funny shake effect

Needed features:
 An option to reassign key bindings

 Gameover screen

 Leveling/points

 If you're a tetris fan: The game-crashing bugs at 155 or something (also the ~800 lines stage)

 (But I wont add them cuz this project is in the past and I should let go of the past)
