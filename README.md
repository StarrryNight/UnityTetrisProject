 # UnityTetrisProject
Made it for a hackathon but unity didnt build it in time to submit it lol.

The Webgl build keeps failing for some reason, so this is the .exe file.

Features:

 Basic tetris game (classic rules) 

 Selectable grids for specific practice

 Randomize/Unrandomize dropping pieces

 Funny shake effect

Needed features:
 An option to reassign key bindings 

(UPDATE: I LIED. I ADDED THE FEATURE AS I REALIZE THAT THE GAME WOULD BE UNPLAYABLE WITHOUT IT)

 Gameover screen

 Leveling/points

 If you're a tetris fan: The game-crashing bugs at 155 or something (also the ~800 lines stage)

 (But I wont add them cuz this project is in the past and I should let go of the past)

Credits to Zigurous on YouTube as assets and basic game functions were learnt from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODLzYI4d-J8
