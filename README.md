# UnityTetrisProject
Made it for a hackathon but unity didnt build it in time to submit it lol.

Features:

Basic tetris game (classic rules) 

Selectable grids for specific practice

Randomize/Unrandomize dropping pieces

Funny shake effect


*Need an option to reassign key bindings (But I wont add it cuz this project is in the past and I should let go of the past)
